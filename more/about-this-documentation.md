Welcome to the Jur Documentation. This documentation will be updated regularly as new features are added. Updates will be tracked through a [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md). This documentation is intended to be easy to understand, accessible to anyone whether or not they are familiar with Web3. Separate publications cover topics in greater detail.

We are building Jur to serve a new market of people who want to create and participate in new forms of social organization. You can influence the direction of Jur; [join our community on Discord](https://go.jur.io/doc2discord) to contribute your ideas.
